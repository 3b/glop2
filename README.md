# glop2
posible future home of glop2, successor to [glop](https://github.com/lispgames/glop), a CL API for interacting with OS windowing APIs, with a focus on graphical applications (games, etc) that draw their own UIs.

For now, just a place to keep track of ideas/goals/projects/etc

if you have ideas/suggestions/places where glop failed you, feel free to add to the [wiki](https://github.com/3b/glop2/wiki) or issues or whateverr
